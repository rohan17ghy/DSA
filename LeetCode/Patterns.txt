Prefix Sum
------------
--> Finding the sum of subarray between i and j in O(1) time

Monoqueue
------------
--> Keeping track of max/min elements over the sliding window can be done using monoqueue. TC: O(n)
A heap can also be used in this case but TC: O(nLog(n)) since insertion and deletion takes O(log(n)) for heaps

Offset approach
