--> When we pass some reference to a function like below
def solve(self, arr, k, index, ans):

Here we have passed a reference to ans variable. array pointed by ans will get changed when the method
returns. DON'T CHANGE THE REFERENCE OF 'ans' VARIABLE ELSE IT WILL GIVE UNEXPECTED RESULT FOR ANS

DON'T DO ans = something, instead change the values of ans 

This error normally happens in recursion when we pass a ans variable in the method and after the method
returns we are expecting to get the answer in ans variable

--> When solving recursion problems if in between we change the number of arguments the recursion
function is taking, then please change the parameters accordingly for the places where the recursive
call is made

--> Using a variable before it is referenced(Normally made in recursion)
