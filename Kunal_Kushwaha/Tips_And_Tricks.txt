--> Sometimes it is better if we handle a part of the problem alone, and make separate functions for different small problems.
This reduces the chances of error with variables and makes cleaner code
--> Whenever we are trying to solve a complicated problem(or which needs mathematical computation), use pen paper 
and write down all the equations and also wat would be the variable conditions and corner cases, then try to code it. Don't try to start coding when u 
understand the problem or have a soln. Exception can be when it is very easy. Like how it is done in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NdhK3tZViQ

--> If we have to work with a dictionary with key as english alphabets then the space complexity will not be O(n) but it will be O(26).
This is a key point that i miss
