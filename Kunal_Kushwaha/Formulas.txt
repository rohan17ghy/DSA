Some formulas are written down in the notes copy. Refer that as well

--> If "s[i]" is a letter and "shift" is a number which denotes number of times "s[i]". But the result should be a letter so the formula would be:
   ((ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + shift) % 26) + ord('a')
   Here we are assuming 'a' is 0 and 'z' is 25, so mod is 26, 0-25 will be remainder. There can be many formulas for this but this is intuitive

--> Finding the decimal part of a number can be done with % 1
Eg: 5.55 % 1 will be 0.55 from intuition
Note: Please be cautious in using float numbers as they can have rounding error. See link below
